## Reflection

This is one of the projects I started in November 2023. The aim of this project was to finally expose myself to the .NET environment and C# in particular after having enough time outside of work. One of the goals of this project was to increase my knowledge of APIs and particularly how they are built since I have experience consuming and testing them.
